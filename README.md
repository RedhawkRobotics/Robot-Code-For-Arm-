# Robot-Code-For-Arm

 Within this repository, Cedar Springs High School's robotics team's arm code will be stored;
The arm code is writen with LabView 2018. The arm is a solid metal rod protruding from the robot and at the end we have created 
a pneumatics based claw that pushes two 2 by 4 boards horizontaly, allowing for them to retract and grip the side of the power cube.
